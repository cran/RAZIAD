Description: It performs regression analysis for zero-inflated and zero-altered data, enabling modeling of sparse response variable distributions and assessing their association with covariates. It computes Maximum Likelihood Estimates (MLE) and conducts model selection using AIC and BIC criteria. Additionally, it calculates Fisher Information, confidence intervals, standard errors, and z-scores for all model parameters.
